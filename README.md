# Data Science Portfolio – Jose Filgueira Orge

This repository serves as a central hub for my **Data Science portfolio**, bringing together projects developed during my Master’s program in Data Science, Big Data & Business Analytics.

The portfolio focuses on **applied data analysis, machine learning, and data-driven problem solving**, with an emphasis on methodological rigor, interpretability, and practical use of data tools.

## 👤 About Me

I am a **junior Data Scientist** with a strong foundation in statistics, data analysis, and machine learning.  
My background combines academic training with hands-on projects covering the full data workflow: from data extraction and preprocessing to modeling, evaluation, and communication of results.

I am particularly interested in **applied data science**, analytics, and business-oriented problem solving.

## 📌 Notes

This portfolio is intended to provide a **clear and honest overview of my current skill set and learning process**.  
All projects are educational or applied exercises, designed to demonstrate methodology, reasoning, and practical use of data tools rather than production deployment.
